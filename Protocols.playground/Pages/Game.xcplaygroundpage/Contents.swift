//: We're building a dice game called _Knock Out!_. It is played using the following rules:
//: 1. Each player chooses a “knock out number” – either 6, 7, 8, or 9. More than one player can choose the same number.
//: 2. Players take turns throwing both dice, once each turn. Add the number of both dice to the player's running score.
//: 3. If a player rolls their own knock out number, they are knocked out of the game.
//: 4. Play ends when either all players have been knocked out, or if a single player scores 100 points or higher.
//:
//: Let's reuse some of the work we defined from the previous page.

//: Now, let's define a couple protocols for managing a dice-based game.



//: Lastly, we'll create a custom class for tracking a player in our dice game.



//: With all that configured, let's build our dice game class called _Knock Out!_



//: The following class is used to track the status of the above game, and will conform to the `DiceGameDelegate` protocol.



//: Finally, we need to test out our game. Let's create a game instance, add a tracker, and instruct the game to play.
